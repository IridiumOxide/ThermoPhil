A simple wrapper for TIGER thermodynamic state calculation program - named after Tiger Woods' greatest rival - that allows the user to run multiple calculations.

It can automatically create input files for a given system and a range of molar concentrations, and retrieve detonation velocity, pressure, temperature and enthalpy from the output file.

Paths are windows-style and reference otvdm.exe (https://github.com/otya128/winevdm) which was used to run the 16bit application on windows 10.

The code is dirty and will likely never be updated.
